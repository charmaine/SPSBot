# SPSBot

## Prerequisites
- [Node.js & NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) to get a public address to your local dev machine
- Registered your bot on [Azure Bot Framework](https://dev.botframework.com/bots/new)
    - Record your app id + password, replace all `YOUR_APP_ID` & `YOUR_APP_PASSWORD` in the repo with those credentials

This bot was made for a demo at SharePoint Saturday for the session-- [Azure Information Protection: Taking a Team Approach From Planning to Adoption](http://www.spsevents.org/city/Vancouver/Vancouver2018/_layouts/15/SPSEvents/Speakers/Session.aspx?ID=45&IsDlg=1).
    
*`aip.html` is to showcase how to embed the Teams bot as a Skype bot within any web page*
